# Campress

This Java program takes any image and cumulatively renders its principal components such that the displayed image transitions from fully compressed back to the original image over time. It uses singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component analysis (PCA) to generate a visually fascinating result!

How to use Campress:
1. Open the code in your IDE (Java) of choice
2. Add your image to the images folder
3. In Main.java, replace "smaller.jpeg" with your image file name
4. Run Main.java
5. Enjoy!
